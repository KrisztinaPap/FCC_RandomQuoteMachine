# FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine Challenge

A web app built for FreeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine challenge.

## Project Challenges:
I built several random quote machines before I was able to pass all the FreeCodeCamp tests and beat this challenge. The versions I created using only vanilla JavaScript and React would not pass without rewriting parts using JQuery. In a previous build, I successfully added an API to pull quotes, but that site is no longer active, and I was not able to find a suitable replacement. (The only decent quote APIs I found at the time were behind paywalls.)

## Features:

- Created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap4
- Quotes are hard-coded in
- 'New Tweet' button shows a random quote and author
- 'Tweet' button creates a new Twitter message with the text "My new favourite quote:" and the curret quote and author, ready to be sent out by the user
